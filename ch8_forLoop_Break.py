fruits =["banana", "grapes", "apples"]

for f in fruits:  # f is our variable ... this program will look for f ... via our if statement where we assign it to bananas
    if f == "banana":
        print("I found the banana")
        break  # break stops the program from evaluating the list, in case you have millions.. more efficient
